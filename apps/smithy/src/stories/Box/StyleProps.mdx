# Style Props

Style props allow you to add any valid CSS property as a React prop.
Style props are converted to `css` and compiled into a className by
Emotion.

The following props are not used as style props, as they are a) used
as HTML attributes and b) not used for actual styling in CSS. They
will be skipped by style props and passed through to your component
unaltered.

- alt
- size
- src

The `width` and `height` props are a special case: They're used to set the
intrinsic size of replaced elements (img, video, etc.), so two things
happen:

1. The width and height props are converted to the width and height CSS
   properties as usual.

2. If Box is rendering as a replaced element (
   `<canvas>, <embed>, <iframe>, <img>, <input>, <object>, or <video>`
   ), preserve and pass width and height through as HTML attributes.

As an escape hatch, you can prefix any style prop with an underscore
to prevent it from being converted to CSS. E.g.:
`<Box _translate="true" />` will compile to
`<div translate="true" />`. Only valid style props will be converted in this manner -- if you add a prop named `_foobar` it will be passed through unaltered as `_foobar`, not `foobar`.
