## Introduction

A library of high-quality components for creating beautiful onboarding and product education in your React apps.
The library helps developers build better onboarding experiences faster so they can focus on what matters most: building great products.

## Why

Product onboarding is one of the most important experiences in your app. It's usually the first thing your users see, and it's the first impression they have of your product.
But it's difficult to get right and slow to build. We believe there needs to be a better way to build and iterate on high-quality onboarding experiences.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¨ Fully customizable components and config
- ðŸ”§ Load images and content from your backend
- âœ¨ Beautiful default UI

## Install

Install the package from your command line.

#### With yarn

```bash
yarn add @frigade/react-onboarding-components
```

#### With npm

```bash
npm install @frigade/react-onboarding-components
```

## Supercharge your onboarding flows
While the above examples contain hard-coded strings and images for illustrative purposes, we highly recommend loading your strings and presentation
layer logic from your API rather than as plain strings in your app.

We built [Frigade](https://frigade.com/) to work seamlessly with `react-onboarding-components` and make it easier for developers to build and scale onboarding. 
With Frigade, you can update onboarding flow without releasing to the app store, integrate 3rd party analytics (Segment, Mixpanel, etc.) to power user targeting, and integrate our API/webhooks to make user data input easy.
